# Agent-TwitterGram

## <u>Description</u>
Use AI agents to becomes experts on a given Twitter account. Each account
own has its own agent, and is placed in a dedicated Telegram group. Agents
use additional context from prompts and related datasets to better understand
the account. Agents periodically update users with daily, weekly, and monthly
summaries of posts, articles etc. The agent can intuitively understand things
like tokenomics, token launch events, staking program etc. Users can also interact
with each agent and ask it anything about the account. Additionally, agents
can identify posts that the users should engage with.
